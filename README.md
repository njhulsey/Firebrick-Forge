# Firebrick-Forge
During my second semester of senior year in highschool I built a forge in my backyard. The plan was to melt aluminum cans and cast them by using what I learned in my digital frabrication class that semester.

WHAT I LEARNED:
- How to build a forge
- Uses of firebrick
- Much of the lingo involved with forging
- How to make molds

MATERIALS USED:
- Firebrick
- Hair Dryer
- Pipe
- Charcoal
- A LOT of aluminum cans
- Crucible
