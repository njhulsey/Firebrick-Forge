# Firebrick-Forge
During my second semester of senior year in highschool I built a forge in my backyard. The plan was to melt aluminum cans and cast them by using the knowledge I learned in my makerspace class that semester. I had a lot of fun with this little project and plan to continue it in the future. 

WHAT I LEARNED:
- How to build a forge
- Uses of firebrick
- Much of the lingo involved with forging
- How to make molds

MATERIALS USED:
- Firebrick
- Hair Dryer
- Pipe
- Charcoal
- A LOT of aluminum cans
- Crucible
